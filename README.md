# To-Do list

## The requirements:

- As a user, I want to, add an item to my to do list
- As a user, I want to, remove an item from my to do list
- As a user, I want to update an item on my to do list
- As a user, I want to make an item on my to do list as complete
- As as user, I want make a previously completed item, not complete, on my to do list

## Approach:

Monolithic CRUD functionality, with testing

## Possible stretch goals:

- React or Vite FE
- Coverage reports
- Documentation
- Searchability
- Select all; de-select all
- UI improvements
- Add additional fields to `items`
- create a second object for User: one-to-many
