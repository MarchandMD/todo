# To-Do list

## The requirements:

-   [x] As a user, I want to, add an item to my to do list
-   [x] As a user, I want to, remove an item from my to do list
-   [x] As a user, I want to update an item on my to do list
-   [x] As a user, I want to make an item on my to do list as complete
-   [x] As as user, I want make a previously completed item, not complete, on my to do list

## Approach:

Monolithic CRUD functionality, with testing

## to do:

-   add default status

## Possible stretch goals:

-   React or Vite FE
-   ~~Coverage reports~~
-   Documentation/readme for usage
-   ~~Searchability~~
-   Select all; de-select all
-   UI improvements
-   Add additional fields to `items`
-   create a second object for User: one-to-many

## Refactor opportunities:
- ~~there's a bug somewhere preventing the use of `model:` argument in the `form_with` parameters; troubleshoot inconsistency, either with name of the model, resource, route, etc....~~
